Welcome to the documentation page of the EMtools add-on
=======================================================

**EMtools** is an add-on of Blender that, as a bridge, creates a connection between the Extended Matrix (.graphml file) and the 3D environment of Blender (proxy files). 
With EMtools users can import, manage, visualize, modify, represent and export all the information (geometries, data and paradata) concerning micro and macro scale contexts, single objects or collection of objects. 

The add-on has been developed by E. Demetrescu at CNR-ISPC (Rome, former CNR-ITABC).


Check out the :doc:`usage` section for information about the installation of the add-on.
For the description of every panel of EMtools, see :ref:`nodes`
